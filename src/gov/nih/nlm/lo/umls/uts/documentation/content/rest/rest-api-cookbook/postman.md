Import these Postman collection files to see examples of how the UMLS API works:

  + [UMLS Authentication](/postman/uts-authentication.postman_collection) \*
  + [Searching By Term](/postman/searching-by-term.postman_collection)
  + [CUI-based lookups](/postman/cui-lookups.postman_collection)
  + [SNOMED CT Examples](/postman/snomedct-examples.postman_collection)
  + [Crosswalk Examples](/postman/crosswalk-examples.postman_collection)

You will need the [Postman application](http://www.getpostman.com/) to interact with these examples.

For help with making authentication calls using Postman, see our tutorial: [UMLS REST API: Authentication and Calling](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/user_education/quick_tours/UTS-API/UTS_REST_API_Authentication.html). You must use an API key to authenticate. Username and password is deprecated.

\* The authentication collection is needed to generate service tickets, which are required to run the calls in the rest of the collections.
Running the examples requires a UMLS API key - [apply for a license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html) today!
