Import these Postman collection files to see examples of how the UMLS API works:

  + [UMLS API Samples](/postman/umls-api-samples.postman_collection) 

You will need the [Postman application](http://www.getpostman.com/) to interact with these examples.

Save the UMLS API Samples file linked above. Then import the file into Postman. 

Running the examples requires a UMLS API key. 

In Postman, create a variable called "api-key" and set it to your API key, which can be found on your [UTS profile page](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/profile).
